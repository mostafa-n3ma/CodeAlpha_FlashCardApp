# FlashCards App

Hey there! Welcome to my FlashCards app. I'm Mostafa Nema Rasheed, and I developed this project as part of my internship at CodeAlpha. This app is all about helping you study with flashcards, quiz yourself, and keep track of your scores. Plus, I've added some cool features to show off my skills.

## Features

- **Create Your Own Flashcards**: With this app, you can make your own flashcards. Add as many cards as you want to your deck!
- **Quiz Yourself**: Test your knowledge by quizzing yourself with the flashcards you've created.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of how well you're doing with built-in score tracking.
- **Advanced Stuff**: I've gone the extra mile by using some advanced techniques:
  - **MvvM Architecture**: This app is built using the MvvM architecture for cleaner and more organized code.
  - **Hilt Dependency Injection**: I've used Hilt for dependency injection to make everything smoother and easier to manage.
  - **Jetpack Compose UI**: The user interface is built with Jetpack Compose, which makes everything look sleek and modern.
  - **Firebase Authentication**: Securely log in with Firebase Authentication.
  - **LiveData & Coroutines**: For smooth and responsive interactions, I've implemented LiveData and Coroutines.
  - **Compose Navigation**: Navigate seamlessly through the app with Jetpack Compose Navigation.
  - **BottomSheetScaffold**: I've added BottomSheetScaffold to make the UI more dynamic and interactive.
